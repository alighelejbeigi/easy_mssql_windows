## üöÄ Usage

Here's a basic guide on how to use the `easy_mssql_windows` package:

### 1. Initialize the Connector

First, create an instance of `OdbcConnector`. It's recommended to manage its lifecycle within a `StatefulWidget` if your connection is tied to a specific screen or part of your application.

```dart
final OdbcConnector odbcConnector = OdbcConnector();

// Optional: If your odbc32.dll is not in a standard system path,
// or if you are using a different ODBC driver manager DLL, you can specify its name:
// final OdbcConnector odbcConnector = OdbcConnector(odbcLibName: 'custom_odbc_driver_manager.dll');
